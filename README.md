# My-Projects

The above projects include the Concepts of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, text SUmmarization, language Modelling, Machine Translation Statistical Analysis, Inferential Statistics, Descriptive Statistcs, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Prediction Using Python and R.
  
These have been part of My research and Academics.

The Text Summarization Models are made using LSTM, GRU models whic are part of Encoder and Decoder Models in Abstractive Text Summarization, Predictive Modelling and Machine Translation.
